Description: The packaged tools allow an easy access to Sentinel-2 Level 1C data
     at the GoogleCloud OpenData Bucket and subsequent processing based on the 
     gdalcubes package. A total number of 206 vegetation indices can be calculated
     and zonal statistcs for polygons can be extracted. The users can specify
     the temporal resolution and the method for space-time resampling. 
     As an external dependency gsutils needs to be installed and users need a 
     valid Google account.
